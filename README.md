## Covid Restaurant Finder Ireland

This is a Tripadvisor style website where users can search for and find information about the status of bars, restaurants and cafes as restrictions change during the Covid pandemic. This project was created using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, NodeJS) and Bootstrap with React for the frontend styling.

## Installation and Running

At present, to install and run the project, download the zip folder from the project Github page, and run the app by executing the command

### `npm start`

in the project main folder.

This runs the app and opens http://localhost:3000 in the browser. If any edits are made and saved in the source code, the browser will reload the page with the changes.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

To run in 'build' mode, execute the command:

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
